        William F. Washburn of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., formerly of Middleboro,
        passed away peacefully on June 4th, 2020. He was 97.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-6">
        A lieutenant in the 351st Bomb Group of the Army Air Forces, Bill flew
        over 30 missions as a navigator in WWII. After the war, he moved to New
        York where he married his first wife Marie Bobb and was father to his
        son Rik. After Marie’s death, he married Jean Lashbrook and moved to New
        Jersey with her three children. In 1965 they moved to Middleboro where
        Bill worked his way up to become president of Robertson Factories. At
        his retirement in 1985, he became the president of the Middleboro Trust
        Company, helping them merge with Rockland Trust. In 1988 he moved to
        West Palm Beach where he spent the remainder of his retirement golfing,
        playing bridge and growing tomatoes. After Jean’s death in 2007, Bill
        married Ying Zhang and they could often be spotted eating oysters at
        Spoto’s restaurant.
    </p>
    <p class="pt-6">
        Bill was sharp, quick -witted and seemingly always two steps ahead until
        the very end. He devoted his life to caring and providing for his
        family.
    </p>
    <p class="pt-6">
        He is preceded in death by his wives Marie and Jean. He is survived by
        his wife Ying, his son and daughter-in-law Rik and Sue Washburn, his
        grand daughter and grandson-in-law Erin and Chris Griffith, his
        great-grandsons CJ and Wesley Griffith, his grandson William Washburn
        and his Miniature English Bulldog Terri.
